# User Tagging in Incident Comments

Keep allows you to mention users in incident comments using the `@username` syntax. This feature enables better collaboration and communication within your team.

## How to Use User Tagging

1. Navigate to an incident detail page
2. In the activity tab, find the comment input field
3. Type `@` to see a dropdown of available users
4. Select a user from the dropdown to mention them
5. Submit your comment

When a user is mentioned in a comment:
- The mention is highlighted in the comment text
- The mentioned user receives a notification
- Workflows with the `user_assigned` trigger can be executed

## Workflow Integration

You can create workflows that trigger when a user is mentioned in a comment. This allows for powerful automation scenarios such as:

- Automatically assigning incidents to mentioned users
- Sending notifications to external systems
- Creating tickets in other platforms
- Escalating incidents based on mentions

### Example: User Mention Notification

```yaml
workflow:
  id: user-mention-notification
  name: User Mention Notification
  description: Sends notifications when users are mentioned in incident comments
  triggers:
    - type: user_assigned
      filters:
        - key: incident_id
          value: r".*"  # Match any incident ID
  actions:
    - name: notify-slack
      provider:
        type: slack
        config: "{{ providers.slack }}"
        with:
          channel: "#incident-mentions"
          message: |
            User @{{ event.mentioned_user }} was mentioned in incident [{{ event.incident_id }}]
            
            **Comment:**
            {{ event.comment_text }}
            
            **Mentioned by:** {{ event.mentioned_by }}
```

### Example: Auto-assign on Mention

```yaml
workflow:
  id: auto-assign-on-mention
  name: Auto-assign on Mention
  description: Assigns incidents to users when they are mentioned with @user take
  triggers:
    - type: user_assigned
      filters:
        - key: comment_text
          value: r"@(\w+)\s+take"  # Match comments with "@username take"
  steps:
    - name: get-user-details
      provider:
        type: keep
        with:
          query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{{ event.mentioned_user }}'"
          single_row: true
  actions:
    - name: assign-incident
      provider:
        type: keep
        with:
          assign_incident:
            incident_id: "{{ event.incident_id }}"
            assignee: "{{ steps.get-user-details.results.id }}"
    - name: notify-assignment
      provider:
        type: slack
        config: "{{ providers.slack }}"
        with:
          channel: "#incidents"
          message: |
            Incident [{{ event.incident_id }}] has been assigned to @{{ event.mentioned_user }}
            based on mention in comment.
```

## User Assigned Trigger

The `user_assigned` trigger type is used to trigger workflows when a user is mentioned in a comment. The trigger provides the following data:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `incident_id` | The ID of the incident where the comment was made |
| `comment_id` | The ID of the comment containing the mention |
| `mentioned_user` | The user who was mentioned (email/username) |
| `mentioned_by` | The user who made the comment (email/username) |
| `comment_text` | The full text of the comment |

### Filtering Mentions

You can use filters to trigger workflows only for specific mentions:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: user_assigned
    filters:
      - key: mentioned_user
        value: "oncall@example.com"  # Only trigger for this user
      - key: comment_text
        value: r"urgent|critical"  # Only trigger if comment contains these words
```

## Technical Details

User mentions are detected using the regular expression `@([a-zA-Z0-9_\.]+)` which matches the @ symbol followed by letters, numbers, underscores, and periods.

Mentions are stored in the database and can be queried for reporting and analytics purposes.
