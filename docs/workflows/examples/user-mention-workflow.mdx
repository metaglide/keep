# User Mention Workflow Example

This example demonstrates how to create a workflow that is triggered when a user is mentioned in an incident comment.

## Use Case

When a user is mentioned in an incident comment, you might want to:
- Send a notification to a specific channel
- Create a ticket in an external system
- Assign the incident to the mentioned user
- Send an email to the mentioned user

## Workflow Definition

```yaml
workflow:
  id: user-mention-notification
  name: User Mention Notification
  description: Sends notifications when users are mentioned in incident comments
  triggers:
    - type: user_assigned
      filters:
        - key: incident_id
          value: r".*"  # Match any incident ID
  actions:
    - name: notify-slack
      provider:
        type: slack
        config: "{{ providers.slack }}"
        with:
          channel: "#incident-mentions"
          message: |
            User @{{ event.mentioned_user }} was mentioned in incident [{{ event.incident_id }}]
            
            **Comment:**
            {{ event.comment_text }}
            
            **Mentioned by:** {{ event.mentioned_by }}
```

## Available Event Data

When a user is mentioned in a comment, the following data is available in the `event` context:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `incident_id` | The ID of the incident where the comment was made |
| `comment_id` | The ID of the comment containing the mention |
| `mentioned_user` | The username of the mentioned user |
| `mentioned_by` | The username of the user who made the mention |
| `comment_text` | The full text of the comment |

## Filter Examples

You can filter the workflow trigger based on various criteria:

### Filter by specific user being mentioned

```yaml
filters:
  - key: mentioned_user
    value: "john.doe"  # Only trigger when john.doe is mentioned
```

### Filter by specific incident

```yaml
filters:
  - key: incident_id
    value: "INC-123"  # Only trigger for incident INC-123
```

### Filter by comment content

```yaml
filters:
  - key: comment_text
    value: r".*urgent.*"  # Only trigger when comment contains "urgent"
```

### Exclude certain users

```yaml
filters:
  - key: mentioned_user
    value: "bot-user"
    exclude: true  # Don't trigger when bot-user is mentioned
```

## Advanced Example: Assign Incident to Mentioned User

This workflow automatically assigns an incident to a user when they are mentioned with a specific keyword:

```yaml
workflow:
  id: auto-assign-on-mention
  name: Auto-assign on Mention
  description: Assigns incidents to users when they are mentioned with @user take
  triggers:
    - type: user_assigned
      filters:
        - key: comment_text
          value: r"@(\w+)\s+take"  # Match comments with "@username take"
  steps:
    - name: get-user-details
      provider:
        type: keep
        with:
          query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{{ event.mentioned_user }}'"
          single_row: true
  actions:
    - name: assign-incident
      provider:
        type: keep
        with:
          assign_incident:
            incident_id: "{{ event.incident_id }}"
            assignee: "{{ steps.get-user-details.results.id }}"
    - name: notify-assignment
      provider:
        type: slack
        config: "{{ providers.slack }}"
        with:
          channel: "#incidents"
          message: |
            Incident [{{ event.incident_id }}] has been assigned to @{{ event.mentioned_user }}
            based on mention in comment.
```

## Implementation Notes

1. The `user_assigned` trigger type is fired when a user is mentioned in a comment using the @username syntax
2. The workflow engine parses mentions using the regex pattern `@([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)`
3. Multiple users can be mentioned in a single comment, and each mention will trigger the workflow separately
4. The workflow will only trigger for valid users that exist in the system
