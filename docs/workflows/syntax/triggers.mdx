## Overview

Triggers in Keep Workflow Engine define **when a workflow is executed**. Triggers are the starting point for workflows and can be configured to respond to a variety of events, conditions, or schedules.


A workflow can have one or multiple triggers, and these triggers determine the specific circumstances under which the workflow is initiated. Examples include manual invocation, time-based schedules, or event-driven actions like alerts or incident updates.

Triggers are defined under the `triggers` section of a workflow YAML file. Each trigger has a `type` and optional additional configurations or filters.

## Supported Trigger Types

### Manual Trigger

Used to execute workflows on demand.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: manual
```

### Interval Trigger

Runs workflows at a regular time.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: interval
    # Run every 5 seconds
    value: 5
```

### Alert Trigger

Executes a workflow when an alert is received, with optional filters for alert properties.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: alert
```

### Filtering Alert

You can filter alerts by specific properties like `severity`, `source`, or use regex to match specific `service`.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: alert
    filters:
      - key: severity
        value: critical
      - key: source
        value: datadog
      - key: service
        value: r"(payments|ftp)"
```

### Incident Trigger

Runs workflows when an incident is created, updated, or resolved.

```yaml

triggers:
  - type: incident
    on:
      - create
      - update
```

### User Assigned Trigger

Executes a workflow when a user is mentioned in an incident comment using the @username syntax.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: user_assigned
    filters:
      - key: mentioned_user
        value: "john.doe"  # Only trigger when john.doe is mentioned
      - key: comment_text
        value: r".*urgent.*"  # Only trigger when comment contains "urgent"
```

Available filter keys:
- `incident_id`: The ID of the incident where the comment was made
- `comment_id`: The ID of the comment containing the mention
- `mentioned_user`: The username of the mentioned user
- `mentioned_by`: The username of the user who made the mention
- `comment_text`: The full text of the comment

### Field Change Trigger

Executes a workflow when specific fields in an alert change, such as status or severity.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: alert
    only_on_change:
      - status

```

## Summary

Triggers are a powerful way to control the execution of workflows, ensuring that they respond appropriately to manual actions, schedules, or events. By leveraging filters and configurations, workflows can be fine-tuned to execute only under specific conditions.
